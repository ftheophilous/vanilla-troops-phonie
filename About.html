            <h2>How we came to be</h2>
            <p>
                Vanilla troops is one amongst the many groups formed within AltSchoolAfrica to carry out the holiday project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like many other groups formed within AltSchool, Vanilla troops is made up of students who cut across the different learning tracks; frontend,
                backend and cloud engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this group is special because it doesn't follow the
                traditional AltSchool grouping which categorizes students in circles.
                Rather, Vanilla troops is more of an offshoot of different persons
                from different circles whose circle members were more or less inactive
                or non-responsive; hence, prompting them to seek out other groups.
            </p>
            <h2>Is the group legal?</h2>
            <p>
                Well, don't fret, Vanilla troops is totally legal. Your concerns as to
                why the group might not be legal is understandable. However, owing to our
                instructor
                <em style="font-style: normal; font-weight: 700;">Jerry Uke</em> giving room for some persons to join other groups,
                mainly on the premise that their original circle was inactive or not
                cordinated, Vanilla troops is fully legal and
                authorized to fly as an adhoc group.
            </p>
            <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p>The project is a simple html form whose phone number field is able to support multiple country codes, and is able to recognize a Nigerian number, majorly the four most popular telcom providers in nigeria: Mtn, Airtel, Glo and 9mobile, and display a logo that corresponds to the respective brands.</p>
          <h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Fill the form with your information and submit. However, the magic only happens after picking Nigeria as your country since the form solely concerns Nigerian telcom providers</p>
