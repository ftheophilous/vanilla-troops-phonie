            <h2>How We Came To Be</h2>
            <p>
                Vanilla troops is one amongst the many groups formed within AltSchoolAfrica to carry out the holiday Project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like many other groups formed within AltSchool, Vanilla troops is made up of students who cut across the different learning tracks; FrontEnd,
                BackEnd and Cloud Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, this group is special because it doesn't follow the
                traditional AltSchool grouping which categorizes students in circles,
                rather Vanilla troops is more like an offshoot of different persons
                from different circles whose circle members might have been inactive
                or non-responsive hence prompting them to seek out other groups.
            </p>
            <h2>Is the group legal?</h2>
            <p>
                Well, don't fret, Vanilla group is totally legal, your concerns as to
                why the group might not be legal is understandable. Owing to Our
                Instructor
                <em>Jerry Uke</em> giving room for some persons to join other groups
                mainly on the basis that their original circle was inactive or not
                cordinated. On such grounds Vanilla group is fully legal and
                authorized to fly as an adhoc group.
